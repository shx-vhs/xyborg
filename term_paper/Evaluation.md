## Introduction

You will be testing a hand-based interactive music system. Xyborg consists of several touch sensors (capacitive sensing), buttons and accelerometers that are fixed to the frame. Similar to a keyboard, you play notes on a chromatic scale while simultaneously being able to control a low-pass filter, vibrato/flanger and distortion effect with the motion of both of your hands. 

At the start of the evaluation, I will give you a quick introduction to the system, introduce it's functionalities and ask you for consent for recording you during the playing. After that, I would like you to execute several musical tasks, all increasing in difficulty and coordination. In the end, I would like you to answer a short questionnaire in written form.
——————————————————————————————
Before we begin, please visit this page and answer the first two questions of the survey.

Now, after we fitted the instrument to your hands and a short introduction, I would like you to execute the following musical tasks:

## Evaluation

Timing controllability
- play several single notes
- play the following intervalls over both hands: major third, perfect fifth, octave
- play a major chord over two hands
- play an arpeggio on one hand, and after that, play an arpeggio over two hands

Feature controllability and Explorability
- play single note and modulate the filter
- play a single note and modulate the vibrato/flanger
- play a single note and modulate the distortion
- play several consecutive notes while navigating the effect that feels most comfortable in manipulating

Reproducibility
- try to play the chord and arpeggio from before again

Improvisation
- You can choose to play over a loop for 2 minutes or just freely play around with the instrument without a backing rhythm

When you are finished, please go back to the survey and finish answering it. Thank you!

Questionnaire

Haptics and Ergonomics
Please rate on a scale from 1 to 7:

Please give the musical tasks a rating in terms of being able to execute them (includes timing):

- single consecutive notes:
- intervals:
- chords:
- arpeggios:


Please give the effects a rating in terms of playing overall controllability (includes control intimacy and reactiveness):
- filter:
- vibrato/flanger:
- distortion:


_________________________________________

Did you feel that the touch sensors and the buttons were appropriately placed for you to reach them or did it feel uncomfortable to play? What was the biggest restraining factor?

Did you feel the touch sensors reacted appropriately and in time?

Did you feel you could communicate your musical idea with the instrument? In other words, how precisely could you translate your idea into motion? What was the biggest restraining factor?

Which functionality/ combination of functionalities did you like the most and why? Did you discover a functionality you did not expect?

Do you have the impression that the instrument is engaging and exciting to play? 


Did you find hidden affordances? In other words, did you find playing techniques that were not obvious from the design of the instrument?
